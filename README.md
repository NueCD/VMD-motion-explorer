# motion.py

A simple tool to convert VMD motion data for Miku Miku Dance into a text file.

<code>Usage: motion.py [input.vmd [output.txt]] | [-h|--help]</code>

There are some issues still with decoding some names. Especially the bone names. I cant manage to decode them so I will just leave it as is for the moment.
The interpolation data is also untouched because I could not find any documentation on it. Not that I looked for very long.

Have fun!
